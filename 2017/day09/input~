<>, empty garbage.
<random characters>, garbage containing random characters.
<<<<>, because the extra < are ignored.
<{!>}>, because the first > is canceled.
<!!>, because the second ! is canceled, allowing the > to terminate the garbage.
<!!!>>, because the second ! and the first > are canceled.
<{o"i!a,<{i<a>, which ends at the first >.
Here are some examples of whole streams and the number of groups they contain:

{}, 1 group.
{{{}}}, 3 groups.
{{},{}}, also 3 groups.
{{{},{},{{}}}}, 6 groups.
{<{},{},{{}}>}, 1 group (which itself contains garbage).
{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, 1 group.
{{<a>},{<a>},{<a>},{<a>}}, 5 groups.
{{<!>},{<!>},{<!>},{<a>}}, 2 groups (since all but the last > are canceled).
Your goal is to find the total score for all groups in your input. Each group is assigned a score which is one more than the score of the group that immediately contains it. (The outermost group gets a score of 1.)

{}, score of 1.
{{{}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
{{},{}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
{{{},{},{{}}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16.
{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, score of 1.
{{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.
{{<!!>},{<!!>},{<!!>},{<!!>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.
{{<a!>},{<a!>},{<a!>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 = 3.
